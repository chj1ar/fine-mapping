# Why SoS

**Multiple kernels in one notebook backed by a workflow engine

Computational biology typically requires a variety of tools implemented by different programming languages. However, switching between languages is usually burdensome. SoS make language switching easy. One can switch between languages by very simple operations like choosing a kernel for each cell or typing the language name at the beginning of a cell with SoS kernel. Sharing needs like data exchange are also supported. SoS workflow engine can recognize them and execute corresponding codes.

**Bridging the gap between interactive data analysis and batch data processing

Allow a smooth transition from interactive data analysis to batch data processing. Pipeline would thus be much easier to develop.

**Remote execution made easy

It is common to develop code at a local laptop and execute it on remote hosts. SoS eases the translation of code between local host and remote host. Having successfully tested some code locally, one can just submit the task to remost hosts.
